# [Last Stand - ft_transcendence](https://165.22.83.77)

If you want to run in development mode, you have run generate.sh and fill the requested fields. This operation will create .env files. Command :
```
make generate
```
### Run Command:
```
make
```

### Stop Command:
```
make fclean
```

Then you can run frontend (laststand):
```
yarn dev
```
Backend (laststand-api)

```
yarn start:dev
```
Of course we assumed you have already run yarn install for both project.
